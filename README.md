# steam-games-marked-32bit-working-on-catalina

This is a little living list of games I noticed working on Catalina even though Steam claims they are 32 bit.

As apple dropped support for 32 bit applications with Catalina, games supporting macOS will be hidden on Catalina if Steam thinks they are 32 bit. Searching these games will still show them, but with a disabled icon next to their name. You can still install these, but ofcourse they might not start, if they are actually 32 bit.

## Supported games

So this is a list of games falsely marked as 32 bit, which run quite fine on Catalina.

 * [Dungeons 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/262280/Dungeons_2/)
 * [Dungeons 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/493900/Dungeons_3/)
 * [Pathfinder: Kingmaker - Enhanced Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/640820/Pathfinder_Kingmaker__Enhanced_Edition/)
 * [Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/560130/Pillars_of_Eternity_II_Deadfire/)
 * [Prison Architect](https://store.steampowered.com/app/233450/Prison_Architect/)
 * [Stonehearth](https://store.steampowered.com/app/253250/Stonehearth/)
 * [Torchlight 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/200710/Torchlight_II/)
 
## Really unsupported games

I figured it would make sense to also tell, which games actually didn't work.
Obviously this list might become invalid if the developers update their games for Catalina.

 * [Age of Wonders III](https://store.steampowered.com/app/226840/Age_of_Wonders_III/)
 * [BioShock Infinite](https://store.steampowered.com/app/8870/BioShock_Infinite/)
 * [Stronghold 3 Gold](https://store.steampowered.com/app/47400/Stronghold_3_Gold/)
 * [Torchlight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/41500/Torchlight/)
 * [Tropico 5](https://store.steampowered.com/app/245620/Tropico_5/)
 
## Contributing

Currently this list is assembled by me going over my Steam library and installing all those "not working" games and checking if they might work. I prioritize games with a higher chance though: I noticed certain series where earlier games are supported, but most recent titles are not. One example are *Tropico* 4 and 6 being supported on Catalina, but 5 is marked as bad. Interestingly *Tropico 5* really doesn't work on Catalina. Another such example is *BioShock Infinite*, which is not supported, despite *BioShock* and *BioShock 2* being supported. Weird developersâ€¦

If you happen to find more games on Steam, that work fine but are marked as not supported, feel free to send me a pull request and I will happily add them.
