# steam-games-marked-32bit-working-on-catalina
This is a little living list of games I noticed working on Catalina even though Steam claims they are 32 bit.

As apple dropped support for 32 bit applications with Catalina, games supporting macOS will be hidden on Catalina if Steam thinks they are 32 bit. Searching these games will still show them, but with a disabled icon next to their name. You can still install these, but ofcourse they might not start, if they are actually 32 bit.

So this is a list of games falsely marked as 32 bit, which run quite fine on Catalina.
